# Mason's Percussion

## A sample pack of percussion sounds from Mason Lynass

### About:

These samples were recorded in 2022 with the help of Johnny Goss at Dandelion Gold Studios in Seattle, WA.

If you purchased the "all mics" option, you received a folder for each microphone or pair of microphones we used to record instruments: 
- one ELA M 251E tube condenser
- one AEA R88 stereo ribbon
- one MXL V67 large diaphragm condenser
- one Neumann U67 large diaphragm tube condenser

If you purchased the "multi mic mix" option, you're working with a preset mix of all of the microphones we used to record - primarily using the R88 as a foundation and adding in other mics to get certain sounds out of certain instruments.

Each microphone folder contains instruments organized in these categories:
- tambourines
- cymbal and gong
- drums
- hit
- shake
- handheld

And each instrument in these folders can contain loops, one shots, or both!

## Download information

You should have received a link to a WeTransfer file download - Gumroad doesn't let you upload folders, which makes uploading a sample pack really tedious and difficult.

If you didn't receive a WeTransfer link, please contact me at masonlynass@gmail.com and I'll send you one!
